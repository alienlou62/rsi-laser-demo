# RSI Laser Demo

A mechanical demonstration showcasing the precision of the RMP system at Robotics Systems Integration (RSI). 
This two-axis gimbal mechanism uses Basler's Pylon SDK, OpenCV, and RMP motion control to track a colored ball 
and dynamically position a laser to center it in real time.

## Features
- Real-time tracking using OpenCV & Pylon SDK
- Two-axis gimbal system
- Dynamic motor control using RSI's RMP
